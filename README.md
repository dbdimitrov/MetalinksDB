# metabolicCCC

Recent advances in the generation of single-cell transcriptomes have enabled the inference of protein-mediated CCC events. However, CCC is not limited to protein-protein interactions, but also includes metabolite-protein interactions. To infer CCC between a sender cell that secretes metabolite ligands and a sensor cell that expresses protein receptors, information on both metabolite and protein abundance must be available. A few methods have been developed recently to address this task. We will assess the different methods and test their influence on the CCC inference results within the framework of a 6-month master's thesis using different datasets and disease conditions. Furthermore, we will implement their functionality in the LIANA framework. This will help other researchers to choose the method most appropriate to their data and scientific question as well as give an impression about overall accuracy of metabolite based CCC inference.
